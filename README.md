# Conveyor Waste Detection

## Overview
This project implements a computer vision application using YOLOv8 to detect PET and PP plastics on conveyor belts, supporting automated recycling. Built with Streamlit and Python, it offers real-time detection for images and videos.

## Features
- Real-time detection of PET and PP plastics.
- Interactive UI with confidence threshold adjustment.
- Downloadable detection results.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/MohammedMadany/Conveyor_Waste_Detection.git`
2. Navigate to the project folder: `cd Conveyor_Waste_Detection`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the app: `streamlit run src/app.py`

## Requirements
- Python 3.12
- Packages: `streamlit`, `ultralytics`, `opencv-python`, `pillow`, `numpy`

## Usage
Upload an image or video via the Streamlit interface and adjust the confidence threshold for detection.
